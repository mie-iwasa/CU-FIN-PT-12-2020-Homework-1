## Overview:
Ant Financial is headquartered in Hangzhou, China and was established as a part of Alibaba in 2004 by Jack Ma and with the inception of Alipay (later rebranded as “Ant Financial”). It was spun-off from the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014 and is the largest fintech company in the world based on revenues, volumes, and number of customers. The firm provides a wide range of services spanning from mobile and online payments (Alipay), money market funds (Yu ‘eBao), wealth management (Ant Fortune), digital-online banking (MYbank), credit scoring (Zhima Credit), consumer credit portals (Ant Credit Pay, Huabei), cloud and blockchain technology platforms (Ant Financial Cloud, AntChain), insurance service platforms (Haoyibao, Quanminbao, Xianghubao), and green environment (Ant Forest).

The firm “was created in the nascent days of e-commerce in China to solve the trust issue between buyers and sellers in online transactions” on the Alibaba marketplace. Trust was a big issue in China as “stores did not trust customers to pay, and customers did not trust stores to send the items.” Through Ant Financial, Alibaba created an escrow system initially using faxes: “the customer would pay, Ant Financial would hold the money in their account, and only release it to the shop when the customer received their item.” This initial system with faxes developed into an online financial transaction system which engendered trust among participants. As of 6/2020, Ant Financial is now on it’s fifth infrastructure refreshment and processes 120,000 transactions per second and 10 billion transactions per day. In comparison, Visa and Mastercard only process 60 billion per year combined.

The firm primarily earns digital payment services revenues by charging merchants transaction fees based on a percentage of volume and by charging technology service fees. Through its “CreditTech” businesses (Zhima Credit, Ant Credit Pay, Huabei, MYbank, Sesame Credit), Ant Financial generates technology service fees from partner financial institutions that are based on the credit balance originated through the firm’s platform. Through its “InvestmentTech” business (Ant Fortune), the firm earns technology service fees from partner financial institutions that are based on the volume of investment products distributed through the firm’s platform. Through its “InsureTech” businesses (Haoyibao, Quanminbao, Xianghubao), the firm receives technology service fees from partner insurance institutions based on a percentage of the insurance premiums and contributions generated through the firm’s platform.

On a fully diluted, pre-IPO basis, Ant Financial is owned by Alibaba (33%), management and employees (51.2%), and domestic China investors (China’s national social security fund and China Investment Corporation, 15.8%). Alipay was supposed to go public in November 2020, with funds from the IPO aimed at further business development, investments, and growth, but the IPO was cancelled due to the Chinese government which is now assessing the Alipay’s parent Alibaba over monopolistic practices. 

## Business Activities:
The firm’s focus is to engender trust in the financial ecosystem and deepen financial inclusion. The firm was “founded to champion the small and the underserved, in the belief that open technology platforms could help service providers and institutions to reach customers that previously were not accessible.” 

Ant Financial is China’s largest fintech player and has enjoyed market power as a first mover. The firm’s scale and scope are driven by it being part of Alibaba’s e-commerce ecosystem and its focus on technology, customer engagement, and partnership model with financial institutions. Key business statistics as of June 30, 2020:

Technology is the foundation of Ant Financial. “Key technology capabilities include AI, machine learning, NLP, image recognition, face recognition, risk management, security, blockchain,” as well as IoT, cloud computing and technology infrastructure. The firm has “patented and scaled up the use of consensus algorithm, smart contract, multi-party computing, and other blockchain based technologies within different use cases. Leveraging these advanced technologies, the firm has built several blockchain based platforms such as AntChain and a supply chain collaboration network.”

## Landscape:
Ant Financial’s growth has been driven by the opening and development of the Chinese domestic financial and consumer market, digitization, big data, and cheaper computing. Not having had any incumbent payments nor credit systems, the Chinese market was well-positioned to ride the technology and mobile phone boom of the 2000s together with the increase in Chinese consumer spend power. “China’s digital payment infrastructure was relatively undeveloped, with cash usage still very high in the early 2000s.” In 2010, Alipay’s independent payment method received official government endorsement, “allowing it to develop largely free of compliance costs and regulatory restrictions.” Over the last 5-10 years, the Chinese consumer together with the Chinese economy has grown massively with increasing consumption to GDP. During this time, the number of unbanked and underserved Chinese decreased with the expansion of Ant Financial products through its mobile phone app. Ant Financial’s  various consumer offerings are accessible via the mobile phone app as well as offline via web and QR Codes. The firm utilizes AI, machine learning, NLP, and blockchain to drive its ability to unlock customer patterns and tastes as well as drive cost and supply chain optimization, risk assessment and risk management.  

Ant Financial operates in the following fintech domains: Payments/billing, investment/wealth management, insurance, personal finance/deposits/online banking, lending, blockchain, robo-advising, and enterprise solutions. Domestic competitors include Tencent (WeChat Pay), JD.com, and Ping An. International competitors include among others Adyen, Avant, PayPal, Klarna, Oscar, Venmo, Stripe, FICO, Visa, Mastercard, Charles Schwab, Lufax, SoFi, and Zero. As of now, Ant Financial is the largest player with such a vast financial ecosystem.

## Results:
Ant Financial’s Alipay mobile app has a reach of over one billion users (~70% of China’s population in 2020) and 80 million merchants. It is the largest fintech company in the world and has an estimated US$313 billion valuation, which makes it worth more than most global banks. Through this app, the firm provides “the digital finance technology, customer reach and risk management solutions to partner financial institutions, enabling them to provide services in consumer credit, SMB credit, investments and insurance to the users and businesses” on the Alipay platform. The firm has been very successful in cross-selling its digital payments services with its digital financial services as 80% of customers use three or more financial services, and 40% use all five services (payments, wealth management, credit scoring, lending, and insurance). See “Business Activities” section for a summary of key metrics and the “Landscape” section for competitors.

## Recommendations:
As Ant Financial’s domestic market matures in terms of financial sophistication and income/investment levels, I suggest the firm expand its offerings in the mass affluent and high net worth customer segments in its areas of banking, investments, and insurance. Moreover, it can leverage its 50-year data-sharing agreement of Alibaba to gain further insights into consumer behaviors of the mass affluent and high net worth customer segments in developing banking, investments, and insurance products.

The majority of Ant Financial’s users are in its home market of China, but the firm also has over 300 million users across India, Thailand, South Korea, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Pakistan. It has a 54% share of the Chinese digital payments market. International growth is where there are the greatest opportunities. The firm should also continue sharing its financial technology expertise in payments, big data and blockchain with developing nations that are also developing their domestic consumer financial markets via mobile phone, e-wallets. In some nations like those in Africa, Ant Financial should partner with local telecom companies. In more developed developing nations like Brazil, it could look to partner with local financial institutions like Bancolumbia, Banco Itau, or NuBank. It can also offer supply chain finance across international SMBs as well as offer payments/transactions solutions.   

Given the pending introduction of the digital yuan by the People’s Bank of China, Ant Financial should also look into cryptocurrencies as forms of payments, deposits/investments as new payment channels stemming from the digital yuan could reduce the firm’s market share.

As a digital enabler of financial services, the firm should also continue expanding into urban and life services such as digital medicine, fitness, charity, food delivery and education, thereby establishing itself as a “LifeTech” firm rather than “FinTech”.
